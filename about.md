Hey! I'm Mike. I'm a software engineer in San Francisco, CA.

I build web apps, usually in Ruby. When I'm not doing that, I'm probably watching hockey or in a gym.

**Work:**
Software Engineer @ [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com).

Previously: [Gazelle.com](http://www.gazelle.com), [Sikorsky Aircraft](http://sikorsky.com), [Pratt & Whitney](http://pw.utc.com).

You should probably follow me on twitter [@mscccc](http://twitter.com/mscccc).

Or connect with me on one of these: [Github](http://github.com/mscoutermarsh), [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/coutermarsh/).

Email me. I love to help!

Drop this in your IRB
```ruby
5000.times { s = " ";(rand*100).to_i.times { s = " " + s }; puts s + "you are awesome"; sleep 1 }
```
