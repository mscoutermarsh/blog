If you don't have one already, install one and start using it. 

- Set a LONG history (mine is 3 months). 
- Now every code snippet you ever copy is in an easily searchable database so you can pull it back up whenever you need it.

I personally use [Paste](https://pasteapp.io/) and it's the best I've found. Whatever you use, make sure it has the ability to search quickly and keep months of data.
