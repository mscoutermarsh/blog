Hey! I'm Mike. I'm a software engineer living in San Francisco, CA.

I love building web apps, usually with Ruby.

I work @ [GitHub](https://github.com/mscoutermarsh) on [Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). 

I grew up on the east coast and moved out to SF to follow the #startupDream. Turns out I really like it here, so I never went back.

Prior to GitHub I was one of the early employees at Product Hunt (a Rails app with a cat mascot). And prior prior to that I worked on Gazelle.com (another Rails app with a gazelle mascot).

I'm on Twitter here [@mscccc](http://twitter.com/mscccc).

I usually don't have time for coffee meetings. Sorry.

If you're learning to code or trying to get into tech, I'm always happy to
answer any questions over email. (short & specific emails are easiest for me)

Drop this in your IRB
```ruby
5000.times { s = " ";(rand*100).to_i.times { s = " " + s }; puts s + "you are awesome"; sleep 1 }
```
