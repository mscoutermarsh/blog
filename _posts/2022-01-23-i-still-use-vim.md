You probably saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NUO4JEtkDw) and are wondering: "After all this time, do you still use vim?".

Yes, I do. And I still love it.

My setup also hasn't changed that much. I still use Vim + iTerm2 for almost all of my work. My [dotfiles are still public](https://github.com/mscoutermarsh/dotfiles) if you'd like to steal them.

#### What about vscode?

I think vscode is great too. It has a [vim plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) that you can enable. Then you get the benefits of keyboard navigation/editing while also keeping all the plugins you like about vscode.
I occasionally use it when writing Go because I find the go plugins helpful.
