title: Working remote - asking a quick question via Slack
---

Quick tip for improving the effectiveness of your communication via Slack.

### Bad
```
Hey, can you do me a favor?
```

### Better
```
Hey, can you do me a favor? This user account is locked out.
```

### Best
```
Hey, can you do me a favor? This user account is locked out
and I get a 500 error when trying to unlock it. Username: mscccc.
Link: example.com/mscccc.
```

### Why?
If you're causing a notification to pop up on someones screen, you're more
likely to get the help you need if you provide all of the information in the
first message. It reduces the back and forth and makes it easy for the other
person to act on your question right away.
