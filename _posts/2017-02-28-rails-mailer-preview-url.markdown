The Rails mailer preview URL is impossible to remember.

**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/rails/mailers`

So I'm putting it here. Hopefully this just saved you time while googling.

If you need more info about how to use previews. Read this: http://api.rubyonrails.org/v4.1/classes/ActionMailer/Base.html
