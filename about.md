Hey! I'm Mike. I'm a software engineer living in ~~Boston, MA~~, ~~San Francisco, CA~~, Pennsylvania.

I love building web apps, usually with Ruby.

I work @ [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com).

Before that, I was at [GitHub](https://github.com/mscoutermarsh) where I built [Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and [Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace). 

I was one of the early employees at [Product Hunt](https://producthunt.com) (sorry, I will not submit products for you).

I'm on Twitter here [@mscccc](http://twitter.com/mscccc).

If you're learning to code or trying to get into tech, I'm always happy to
answer any questions over email. (short & specific emails are easiest for me)

Drop this in your IRB
```ruby
5000.times { s = " ";(rand*100).to_i.times { s = " " + s }; puts s + "you are awesome"; sleep 1 }
```
