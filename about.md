Hey! I'm Mike. I'm a software engineer living in San Francisco, CA.

I love building web apps, usually with Ruby.

I work @ [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com).

I'm on Twitter here [@mscccc](http://twitter.com/mscccc). And here's my [GitHub](http://github.com/mscoutermarsh).

I love helping people who are learning to code. I currently mentor the agile
group project course for [The Firehose Project](https://thefirehoseproject.com).

If you're learning to code or trying to get into tech, I'm always happy to
answer any questions over email!

Drop this in your IRB
```ruby
5000.times { s = " ";(rand*100).to_i.times { s = " " + s }; puts s + "you are awesome"; sleep 1 }
```
