title: Serverless + Cloudflare Workers + NPM Modules
---

Here is how I got NPM modules working with Cloudflare workers + Serverless.

1. Install webpack

```
npm install --save-dev webpack
```

2. Add a webpack config. `webpack.config.js`

```
module.exports = {
  target: 'webworker'
};
```

3. Add `build` to your `package.json`

```
"build": "webpack yourFunctionFile.js",
```

4. Update your `serverless.yml`.

```
functions:
  helloWorld:
    worker: hello
    script: dist/main  # This file is generated by webpack
```

Then you can use `require` inside of your function. :tada:
