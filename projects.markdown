Hello! I've gotten to work on a lot of really fun projects over the years. Here are some highlights from my favorites.

### Product Hunt Shop (2016)
*Ruby, JavaScript, Stripe*

### tweet-characters-left (2015)
*JavaScript, Node Module*

I put a lot of focus on improving my JavaScript skills in 2015. Part of that was learning how to release my first node module.

tweet-characters-left is simple. It calculates the # of characters left in a tweet, just as Twitter would. We use this node module in the Tweet Composer on Product Hunt.

This project was my favorite of 2015.

I wrote about how this project came about on Medium: [Better Sharing on Producthunt](https://medium.com/@mscccc/better-sharing-on-product-hunt-4e3da73824bb#.u7udq7k2a)

### Product Hunt LIVE - Real Time Comments (2015)

*Ruby/Rails, React.js, Pusher*

![LIVE real time comments](/assets/archive/images/2015/Nov/live_example.png)

Shortly after we launched [Product Hunt LIVE](https://www.producthunt.com/live), the most common feature request we received from participants was *"I want to know when a question is answered."* This feature was really challenging to get right. We had new comments/questions streaming in, but needed a nice way to update the page so that the experience would be really smooth for the end user. This was the first major feature that I wrote using React.js (backend is Rails/Pusher web sockets). I learned a lot of React in the process and I'm really happy with what we ended up with.

### AddEvent API - Ruby (2015)
*Ruby API client for the AddEvent.com API.*
GitHub: https://github.com/mscoutermarsh/AddEvent-Ruby

[AddEvent.com](https://addevent.com) provides a really nice API for making calendar events (Gmail, Outlook, iCal). I got started with this when building [Product Hunt LIVE](https://www.producthunt.com/live). We wanted to make it super easy for anyone to add a LIVE event to their calendar. We needed to be able to generate these events from Ruby. From that, this Ruby API wrapper was born ðŸ˜ƒ.

### Heroku Cookbook (2014)
*Recipes to solve the challenges of administering and scaling a real-world production web application on Heroku*
Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Heroku-Cookbook-Mike-Coutermarsh/dp/1782177949

![Heroku Cookbook](/assets/archive/images/2015/Nov/herokusmall.jpg)
I've always **loved** Heroku & had been writing about them for years. At the end of 2013 I was approached by a publisher to contribute some of my blog posts to a Cookbook on Heroku. I started writing an outline on everything I thought people needed to know about Heroku to run large production applications. It quickly grew & I ended up with enough material for a book on my own. With the help/support of the awesome team at Packt Publishing +
a year of nights and weekends later, the Heroku Cookbook was published.

### Gazelle Certified (2014)
Website: https://buy.gazelle.com/

While working for Gazelle.com I had the opportunity to work on Gazelle's new direct to consumer e-commerce store (buy.gazelle.com). I worked on the backend/intermediary systems between the store front and the Gazelle warehouse. I was specifically responsible for building the credit card processing, setting up the inventory sync/management, and integrating credit card fraud detection systems. The store was a huge success & I'm very proud to have been a part of it.

### RSpec Rainbow (2014)
*Minitest Pride Formatter, but for Rspec*
GitHub: https://github.com/mscoutermarsh/rspec-rainbow

![RSpec Rainbow](/assets/archive/images/2015/Nov/rspec-rainbow.jpg)

I always loved the Pride formatter for Minitest. I thought it was a shame that it wasn't also available for RSpec. So I built it ðŸ˜».
